Currently, the supported methods are as follow:

* Multi-Objetive Optimization by Ration Analysis (MOORA) and the "Full Multiplicative Form" (MULTIMOORA).
* Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) Method with the linear transformation of maximum as normalization prodecure.
* Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) Method with the vectorial normalization prodecure.

Please kindly give suggestion and report issues to the [development page.](https://github.com/aswansyahputra/mcdm/issues)
